## [2026-07-25] SKILL-141-goal-parent-resume-lifecycle (subtask 1: parent-workflow-non-terminal-status)
Areas: runtime-application, runtime-infra-fs, runtime-mcp
- Added non-terminal `paused` parent-workflow status; GoalRunnerWorkflowStores.importFromManifestProjection and DecompositionWorkflowContinuation stamp `paused` on interruption instead of `abandoned`
- DecompositionWorkflowRuntimeLookup.findDecomposedParentWorkflow reuses non-terminal parents; isStaleAbandonedLineage never GCs them
- GoalChildPlanningHydrator hydrates from non-terminal parents preserving GoalPlanningIdentity; resume reuses the existing parent workflow id with no identity loud-fail
- FeatureTaskRuntimePhasePromptComposer updated to recognise the new status
- AgentRunCommandBuilders (runtime-infra-fs): foreground driver propagates and detects paused parent status on launch
- McpToolRegistry (runtime-mcp): removed `paused` from feature_task_runtime_workflow_update enum; runtime tool now advertises only statuses FeatureTaskRuntimePhaseWorkflowDefinition accepts; prose tool retains paused unchanged
- Explicit operator abandonment path unchanged: still terminal, reason-required, stamps operator-abandonment artifact
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 7/7 implemented
