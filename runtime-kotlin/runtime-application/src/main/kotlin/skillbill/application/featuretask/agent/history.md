# featuretask runtime boundary history

## [2026-08-03] SKILL-157 — Semantic loop warning threshold
Areas: runtime-application/featuretask, runtime-domain/workflow/taskruntime, runtime-application tests, runtime-domain tests
- Semantic remediation loops (`review_fix`, `audit_gap`) stay unbounded; crossing iteration 3 emits one user-visible advisory naming the loop, threshold, iteration, and current work
- Backward-edge declarations carry `warnAfterIterations`; non-semantic bounded edges keep their caps and leave the field null
- Warning acknowledgement is persisted per loop and per subtask, so crash or parent resume yields at-most-once emission and the two loops warn independently
- Emission is a pure side channel: destination, edge iteration, verdict, phase status, unresolved items, and completion outcome are byte-equivalent under Noop, recording, and throwing diagnostics sinks
- Pattern: express advisory-only loop policy as a declared edge field consumed by the run loop, not as control flow in the transition decision
- Reusable: acknowledgement-keyed at-most-once diagnostics for any durable-state loop
- Limitation: warns once at crossing only; no periodic reminder and no hidden hard ceiling
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 7/7 implemented

## [2026-07-28] SKILL-134 — Structured audit deferral
Areas: runtime-application/featuretask, orchestration/contracts, runtime-application tests
- Replaced recursive free-text deferral detection with explicit `deferred_repairs` and exhaustive per-item `repair_results`
- Enforced exact repair identifiers, dependency order, terminal outcomes, changed-path/symbol evidence, executed verification, and blocked-item consistency
- Preserved actionable diagnostic rule IDs and JSON paths while allowing legitimate future-phase language in summaries and evidence
- Pattern: validate remediation authority from structured fields only; keep human-readable text non-authoritative
- Reusable: shared structured repair projection validation across producer retry gates, standalone runtime, and goal-child execution
- Breaking changes/limitations: planning projection contract now requires `deferred_repairs`; completed remediation must leave it empty
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 6/6 implemented

## [2026-07-28] SKILL-134 — Rejected output diagnostics
Areas: runtime-application/featuretask, runtime-cli/featuretask, runtime-contracts, runtime-domain, runtime-ports, runtime-infra-fs, runtime-infra-sqlite, orchestration/contracts
- Persisted one exact rejected phase response per stable workflow/phase/attempt identity before retry or block, with typed metadata, digest, byte size, and deduplication
- Added deterministic size, retention, corruption, cleanup, and owner-only file-permission enforcement behind typed service and persistence boundaries
- Kept raw bodies out of workflow artifacts and ordinary projections; metadata is the default CLI view and exact output requires an explicit raw-output flag
- Extended quarantine metadata with structured diagnostic identity while preserving diagnostic records as non-authoritative for workflow continuation
- Reusable: `RejectedOutputDiagnosticService`, repository port/model, schema validator adapter, and shared privacy assertions
- Pattern: persist privacy-sensitive forensic output separately from workflow authority, expose metadata by default, and require explicit retrieval for raw content
- Breaking changes/limitations: diagnostic and quarantine contract versions changed; storage is local-only and exact responses are not automatically redacted
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 6/6 implemented

## [2026-07-27] SKILL-138-cursor-full-agent-support
Areas: runtime-application/featuretask, runtime-infra-fs/launcher/agentrun, runtime-infra-fs/infrastructure/fs, runtime-cli/tests, skills/bill-code-review*, scripts, docs
- Extended featuretask runtime loop to support Cursor as a full agent provider with strategy-based lifecycle callbacks, stream parsing, and crash reconciliation
- Added Cursor-specific command builder supporting `/<worker>` CLI syntax, tool-denied permissions via isolated `.cursor/cli.json`, and fresh-process review isolation
- Introduced typed error hierarchy for Cursor review streams: malformed, empty, forbidden operation, provider failure, and termination errors
- Updated governed skills `bill-code-review` and `bill-code-review-parallel` with Cursor routing, native subagent instructions, and CLI-delegated parallel review
- Documented exact Cursor paths, commands, generated boundaries, and support tier across README, capabilities, getting-started guides, and internal architecture docs
- Created live parity harness testing 7 scenarios: install, MCP startup, runtime feature task, decomposed goal, delegated/parallel review, workflow resume, and uninstall preservation
- New patterns: Strategy-based agent provider injection (progressProbe, lifecycleCallbacks, idlePolicy, usePtyStdio) without conditional branching in ProcessWaitLoop
- Reusable components: `CursorNativeReviewLifecycleCallbacks` for stream event parsing, `CursorAgentRunCommandBuilder` for review detection and command building, typed `CursorReviewStreamErrors` hierarchy
- Breaking changes: None (provider-agnostic contract preserved, native-agent sources remain provider-neutral)
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 7/7 implemented
