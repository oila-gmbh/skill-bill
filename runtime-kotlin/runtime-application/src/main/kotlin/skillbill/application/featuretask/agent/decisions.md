# featuretask runtime boundary decisions

## [2026-09-10] write_history and commit_push never reopen earlier phases
Context: After the bounded review_fix round, implement_fix leaves owned dirty files. commit_push treated that as a stale review, wiped audit and later phases, and the drive loop bounced back to audit.
Decision: `write_history` and `commit_push` stay forward-only. Owned implement/implement_fix paths plus declared boundary-history may be finalised. Foreign dirty content blocks needs_human. Matching subtask trailer on HEAD keeps review identity across tree drift.
Reason: The shipped topology already allows only `audit_gap` and `review_fix`. Replaying audit/review from finalisation discarded a completed review-fix round and could not converge while the same owned files stayed dirty.
Alternatives considered: Keep re-entering audit for any non-history dirty path (rejected: infinite bounce after a legal implement_fix). Stage history-only and leave implement_fix files dirty (rejected: the bounded fix round would never land).
Revisit when: a later phase needs a declared backward edge, which would be a topology change rather than a finalisation side path.
