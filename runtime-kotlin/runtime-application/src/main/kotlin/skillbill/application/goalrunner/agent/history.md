## [2026-09-03] SKILL-230 subtask 2 — Concurrent planning status wire
Areas: orchestration/contracts/ide-status-schema, runtime-contracts/workflow, runtime-domain/goalrunner.model, runtime-ports/goalrunner, runtime-infra-sqlite/db.workflow, runtime-application/{goalrunner/planning,idestatus,work}, runtime-cli/goal, runtime-mcp/workflow
- `GoalPlanningStatusSnapshot` carries `planningWaveSubtaskIds` (manifest-ordered missing-plan ids, capped at `GOAL_PLANNING_WAVE_CAP`); the domain `init` requires `currentPlanningSubtaskId` to equal the wave minimum, so the IntelliJ plugin and VS Code extension keep reading one id with no edit.
- `GOAL_PLANNING_WAVE_CAP` (5) lives in runtime-contracts beside `IDE_STATUS_CONTRACT_VERSION`; the burst-schedule default, the wire-model guard, and the schema `maxItems` parity test all read it, so one edit moves cap, dispatch, and contract together. reusable
- Wave derivation moved out of `GoalPlanningStatusProjectionSql` into `GoalPlanningStatusSnapshotDerivation` (infra-sqlite): the wave is the first `cap` missing ids only for PREPLANNED/PARTIALLY_PLANNED, empty for NOT_STARTED/PREPARED/BLOCKED, and adds no query to the status read path.
- Schema: additive optional `planning_wave_subtask_ids` (minItems 1, uniqueItems, maxItems 5) at unchanged `contract_version` 0.2; `IdeStatusPlanning.toStatusWireMap()` omits the key when empty and rejects blank, duplicate, or over-cap entries at construction.
- `alignPlanningStatusWithLaunchRecoverability` clears the wave in the same copy that rewrites a resume-claiming reason to non-resumable, so status never names in-flight subtasks it cannot resume and `GoalPlanningStatusReasonCoherence` still holds.
- Goal CLI JSON and MCP carry `planning_wave_subtasks` as integers; the `work status` summary and the goal human line name the concurrent count (`wave=N subtasks`).
- Pattern: a defaulted field inserted before a non-defaulted one breaks positional constructors; three callers moved to named arguments instead of appending the field at the end. reusable
- Limitation: the wave is a projection of the missing-plan set, not liveness — a wedged lane and a healthy one look identical; per-lane heartbeat stays a non-goal.

## [2026-09-03] SKILL-230 subtask 1 — Bounded parallel plan fan-out
Areas: runtime-application/goalrunner/planning, runtime-ports/concurrency, runtime-ports/goalrunner.model, runtime-infra-fs, runtime-core/di
- Goal planning sweep dispatches missing subtask plans in waves of at most `GoalPlanningBurstSchedule.planFanOutCap` (default 5) through the new `BoundedWorkFanOutPort`; the 20s `planLaunchPace` inter-launch gate and per-launch `firstMissingSubtaskId` re-derivation are gone, replaced by one `recoveryProgress` read into an ordered `missingSubtaskIds` set.
- `BoundedWorkFanOutPort` returns one `Result` per input in input order so a failing unit cannot lose sibling results; `CancellationException` rethrows on the caller thread instead of being laundered into a failed `Result`. Ships with `SequentialBoundedWorkFanOutPort` as the deterministic test default. reusable
- `JdkBoundedWorkFanOutPort` lives in runtime-infra-fs next to `JdkRuntimeTimingPort` (daemon pool sized `min(cap, unitCount)`, shut down on every exit path) so runtime-application main stays free of threading APIs and `RuntimeLayerBoundaryArchitectureTest` holds.
- Pattern: drain the whole wave before choosing a stop and pick the lowest input-order failure, so the reported `currentSubtaskId`/`blockedReason` do not depend on thread completion order and sibling plans stay checkpointed. reusable
- Pattern: per-subtask output-sink decorator emits whole attributed lines under the port's mutual exclusion, keyed by `AgentRunOutputStream` because one sink is driven by both stdout and stderr drain threads. reusable
- Pause is checked before a wave and between waves on top of the per-attempt check; the post-drain check is skipped after the final wave so a fully prepared sweep still returns `PreparedAll`, never `PAUSED`.
- Fan-out port DI landed in `RuntimeComponentBindingsA7`/`RuntimeComponentProvides13` (not A5/Provides4) because those files already hold detekt's 10-function ceiling; Provides13 already owns `goalPlanningSweepLaunchPort`.
- Limitation: cap is not operator-configurable, preplan stays serial, and `currentPlanningSubtaskId` still carries a single value — concurrent-planning status reporting is subtask 2.
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 9/9 implemented

## [2026-08-29] SKILL-220 subtask 5 — Oversized goal-runner decomposition
Areas: runtime-application/goalrunner (+ planning), runtime-domain/{goalrunner.model,workflow.goal.model}, runtime-infra-sqlite/db/workflow
- Split P-08 goal-runner monoliths (`GoalRunner`, workflow stores, planning sweep/prep store, status service, review state/reducer, child repair, domain models) into named collaborators; facades stay under 500 lines; new production files max ~396.
- Kept `GoalRunner` as the sole public orchestration entry; extracted helpers stay package-internal; atomic writes and lease/wait boundaries unchanged; JDBC/SQL stays in infra-sqlite.
- Pattern: responsibility-named internal collaborators behind thin facades; remove LargeClass/TooManyFunctions/LongParameterList suppressions the split makes unnecessary. reusable
- Limitation: leftover `@Suppress` is SKILL-221; feature-task and remaining oversized units are other subtasks; no schema/CLI verb changes.
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 8/8 implemented

## [2026-08-24] SKILL-200 subtask 4 — Runtime-owned preflight and add-on resolution
Areas: runtime-application/{goalrunner,featuretask,decomposition,workflow}, runtime-domain, runtime-cli/goal, runtime-infra-{fs,sqlite}, runtime-ports, orchestration/contracts
- Added read-only `skill-bill goal preflight` projections for continuation verdicts, the confirmation gate, and missing Linear spec rehydration targets without launch-side effects.
- Reused continuation classification and resolved raw ordered add-on slugs inside `goal`, while preserving structured source-identity and content-digest verification.
- Pattern: keep pre-launch decisions in a read-only runtime projection and share classification and selection seams with launch. reusable
- Limitation: Linear fetching remains agent-side; preflight reports missing targets but does not retrieve them.
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 17/17 implemented

## [2026-08-22] SKILL-204 subtask 2 — Route non-last goal children through build
Areas: runtime-application/goalrunner, runtime-application/featuretask, runtime-domain/workflow/taskruntime, runtime-cli/featuretask, runtime-infra-fs/launcher/agentrun
- Goal continuation stamps `build` for every non-skipped child before the last non-skipped manifest entry, and `validate` for that last child; skipped ordinal-last promotes validation, while single-child and non-goal launches keep `validate`.
- Child loop and status carry the active build selection; build-stamped visits skip collect-all validation and settle into write-history.
- Write-history and commit-push handoffs require exactly the selected settled receipt (`build_receipt` or `validation_receipt`); legacy or absent selection resolves to `validate`.
- Pattern: persist gate choice on goal-continuation context and validate the selected receipt at the downstream phase edge. reusable
- Limitation: intermediate build children defer full validation debt to the final non-skipped child.
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 6/6 implemented

## [2026-08-20] SKILL-190 — Completed-upstream-missing-output child repair wedge
Areas: runtime-application/goalrunner, runtime-application/featuretask, runtime-cli/goal
- `GoalRunnerChildRepairOperations` diagnoses and applies `COMPLETED_UPSTREAM_MISSING_OUTPUT`: earliest unsettled `completed` upstream for a blocked consumer is reopened to `pending` with ledger retry evidence
- Repair apply now runs inside `UnitOfWork`, returns `GoalRunnerChildRepairApplyResult`, and projects parent manifest state through `updateGoalParentForBlockedPhaseRetry` when a validator is wired
- `WorkflowGoalRunnerOutcomeStore.applyChildWedgeRepairs` persists manifest projection artifacts to the decomposition file after repair
- CLI `goal repair` help documents the wedge alongside continuation-outcome and validation-depth repairs
- Reusable: wedge apply result that separates applied repairs from optional manifest projection side effects
- Limitation: wedge does not amend commits, rewrite review history, or replace goal reset/replan/accept
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 5/5 implemented

## [2026-08-11] SKILL-181 subtask 4 — Distinct exit codes and truthful planning stops
Areas: runtime-application/goalrunner, runtime-cli/goal, runtime-domain/goalrunner model, runtime-infra-sqlite/db/workflow, runtime-core/di, skills/bill-feature-goal
- Goal run exit codes: complete=0, failed/timeout=1, paused=2, blocked=3 (CLI help + bill-feature-goal)
- Incompatible-provenance stops name `replan --include-shared-preplan` via shared remedy builders; drop "cannot be recovered" wording
- Status `planning_reason` overlays launch Invalid recoverability so resume claims disappear when launch would refuse
- Patterns: `goalRunExitCode`; `GoalPlanningOperatorRemedies`; `LaunchAlignedGoalPlanningStatusReasonCoherence` + `GoalPlanningStatusReasons`
- Reusable: remedy string helpers and status-reason coherence seam for other planning stops
- Limits: pause/resume control semantics unchanged; StaleValid still refreshable in-run (no status overlay)
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 6/6 implemented

## [2026-08-11] SKILL-181 subtask 3 — Terminal-with-commit plan cascade exclusion
Areas: runtime-application/goalrunner + workflow, runtime-ports/persistence, runtime-infra-sqlite/db/workflow, runtime-cli/goal, skills/bill-feature-goal, runtime-kotlin/agent/decisions.md
- Shared eligibility helper: cascade only when manifest subtask is not (`complete` + non-blank `commit_sha`); used by scoped replan `--include-shared-preplan` and heading-set refresh replace
- Soft-invalidate shared preplan when survivors remain (FK ON DELETE CASCADE must not wipe terminal plan rows); delete only when no retained plans
- `replaceSharedPreplan` deletes an explicit cascade id list then restamps remaining plan provenance in the same transaction; relaunch regeneration restamps survivors without re-cascading
- Patterns: `cascadeEligiblePlanSubtaskIds` / `isTerminalWithCommitPlan`; `invalidateSharedPreplan`; `restampSubtaskPlanProvenance`
- Limits: exit codes / `planning_reason` remain subtask 4; scoped replan without `--include-shared-preplan` still deletes only the named plan
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 5/5 implemented

## [2026-08-11] SKILL-181 subtask 2 — In-run stale-valid preplan refresh
Areas: runtime-application/goalrunner + workflow, runtime-ports/persistence, runtime-infra-sqlite/db/workflow, runtime-core/di, .feature-specs/SKILL-181-preplan-provenance-refresh
- StaleValid no longer stops prepare: one in-run shared-preplan refresh per launch, gated by child-aware liveness (parent prepare lease treated as IDLE so it cannot self-refuse)
- Heading-set equality on `selected_boundary_headings` decides outcome: same set advances provenance only and keeps payload bytes + all sibling plans; changed set adopts the new payload and discards via shared cascade helper
- Atomic refresh persist: `replaceSharedPreplanForRefresh` leaves either the prior valid record or the new one — never a provenance/payload mismatch mid-crash
- Patterns: `GoalPlanningRefreshLiveness` / `ChildAwareGoalPlanningRefreshLiveness`; `refreshedThisPrepare` latch; cascade only through `cascadeSiblingPlansAfterSharedPreplanRefresh` (reusable seam for ST3 terminal filter)
- Limits: cascade filtered by terminal-with-commit exclusion in subtask 3; exit codes / `planning_reason` remain subtask 4; explicit `replan --include-shared-preplan` still force-regenerates
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 7/7 implemented

## [2026-08-11] SKILL-181 subtask 1 — Validity vs freshness provenance gate
Areas: runtime-application/goalrunner, .feature-specs/SKILL-181-preplan-provenance-refresh
- Replaced single equality `recoverableProvenance` with `classifyGoalPlanningProvenanceRecoverability`: Valid (manifest hash, phase-output schema id, parent-spec self-hash, payload sha, selected heading ids in the fresh model-free catalog) vs Fresh (canonical parent-spec equality)
- Outcomes: Reuse when valid+fresh; StaleValid keeps the checkpoint and continues prepare without `incompatibleProvenance` (in-run refresh is subtask 2); Invalid still loud-stops at preplan / subtask 0
- Pattern: never short-circuit on provenance equality alone — payload integrity and heading resolution always run when a checkpoint exists; catalog ids come from `contextDiscovery`, not the recovered packet
- Reusable: `GoalPlanningProvenanceRecoverability` sealed result (`Reuse` / `StaleValid` / `Invalid`) and `selectedBoundaryHeadingIds` helper shared with body resolution
- Limitation: StaleValid does not yet re-run preplan, cascade, CLI replan, exit codes, or `planning_reason`
Feature flag: N/A
Acceptance criteria: 5/5 implemented
