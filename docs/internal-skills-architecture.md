# Internal Skills Architecture

How dispatch-only skills become one visible entry point: the `internal-for`
classification, the sidecar install mechanism, the file-read dispatch
contract, and where every piece of prose, runtime, and agent machinery lives.
This is the architecture companion to the authored contract in
[skill-source-generation.md](skill-source-generation.md) (Internal Skills
section), which owns the normative rules.

Two families are worked examples here: the feature-execution family (the
SKILL-102 origin case, base-skill internals) and the code-review family
(SKILL-104, the platform-pack extension).

## Part 1 — The feature-execution family (base-skill internals, SKILL-102)

### The idea in one paragraph

The feature entry family has one listed skill: `bill-feature`. The runtime
owns preparation, continuation, execution, and durable goal state, while
`bill-feature-spec` remains the separate listed skill for preparing governed
specification artifacts. There is no goal sidecar or hidden feature entry.

## What install produces

The agent skill list shows `bill-feature` and `bill-feature-spec`. The symlink
in the agent's skills directory points into the content-addressed staging
cache:

```
~/.claude/skills/bill-feature
  → ~/.skill-bill/installed-skills/bill-feature-<content-hash>/
      SKILL.md                            rendered governed wrapper — what the agent lists
      content.md                          authored source, copied verbatim
      platform-packs → …                  symlink for pack pointer resolution
```

Feature-task and goal phase work runs inside the Kotlin runtime driver
(`skill-bill feature-task` / `skill-bill goal`). Platform-pack review packs
still install their own native subagents outside the skills directory.

## Where the source lives (nothing moved)

The feature entry keeps its normal source path and has no internal feature
skill:

```
skills/
  bill-feature/content.md                     listed — the single entry point
  bill-feature-spec/content.md                listed — spec preparation, still Skill-tool invoked
```

The Kotlin runtime binds to retained workflow files by repo path, and
`RepoValidationRuntime` asserts workflow-step markers inside retained workflow
surfaces such as `bill-feature-verify/content.md`. Workflow rows, the database
`workflow_name` constraint, telemetry constants, and MCP tool names retain
their durable identities.

## How routing works, end to end

Everything funnels through `bill-feature`, which gathers intake, performs one
runtime preflight, presents the runtime-composed gate, rehydrates only listed
spec files, launches the goal runtime, and relays its output.

```
user: "implement feature …" / "goal status" / …
  │
  ▼
bill-feature                                     [listed]
  │  intake → update check → goal preflight
  │    new work → feature-spec preparation
  │    runnable verdict → one confirmation gate
  │    rehydrate_targets → listed Linear specs only
  │    confirmed → goal runtime
  │    runtime output → verbatim relay
  ▼
bill-feature-spec                                [listed, Skill tool]
  │  produces governed artifacts
  └── returns control to the single feature entry point
```

The entry forwards the issue key and caller-selected review,
parallel-review, and agent add-on values to the runtime without resolving
another skill or sidecar.

## How the install pipeline produces this

One classification, read through one parser, validated by one rule evaluator,
consumed at three seams:

- **Classification.** `parseInternalForFrontmatter` is the single place that
  reads the key (first occurrence wins; a blank value is preserved so it can
  fail loudly, never "treat as listed"). `InternalSkillClassification.kt`
  holds the one rule evaluator: parent must exist, must be a listed *base*
  skill, must not be the skill itself, no chaining (depth 1), and
  platform-pack skills cannot carry the key at all. Authoring discovery and
  install-plan building throw the first violation as a typed
  `InvalidInternalSkillClassificationError`; `skill-bill validate` reports
  every violation as an issue.
- **Planning.** `discoverBaseSkills` carries `internalFor` onto each
  `InstallPlanSkill`. Staging intents are only emitted for skills that
  actually stage standalone — internal skills get none.
- **Staging.** When a parent stages, `discoverInternalSidecarTargets` finds
  its children under the plan's skills root, renders each child's governed
  wrapper once (one authoring-discovery walk per staging operation), writes
  them as `<skill-name>.md` into the parent's staging dir, and folds the
  rendered bytes into the parent's **content hash**. That hash fold makes the
  system self-maintaining: editing a child's `content.md` invalidates the
  parent's cache entry and re-renders the sidecar on the next install. The
  hash section is appended only when children exist, so a repo with no
  internal skills produces byte-identical output to the pre-SKILL-102
  pipeline.
- **Linking.** Agent skills-dir symlinks are created only for non-internal
  skills. The direct path is guarded too: `skill-bill link-skill` against an
  internal skill's directory refuses with the same typed error.
- **Reuse and repair.** A cached staging dir is reused only if its hash
  marker, `SKILL.md`, *and every expected sidecar* are intact; anything
  pruned or half-written triggers a clean re-render. Uninstalling the parent
  removes its one symlink — the sidecars live inside the parent's staging
  dir, so there is nothing separate to clean up.

### Guardrails enforced at `skill-bill validate` time

- All classification rules above, as repo-validation issues.
- **Collision guard:** an authored file in a parent's source dir occupying
  a would-be sidecar name (e.g. an authored `bill-code-review/bill-kotlin-code-review.md`)
  fails validation and staging (`InternalSkillSidecarCollisionError`).
- **Reference co-location:** every `` `<skill-name>.md` `` sidecar reference
  inside any skill's prose must resolve to an internal skill sharing the
  referencing skill's effective parent — so re-parenting or de-listing one
  family member breaks validate, not a live session with a file-not-found.
- **README catalog:** internal skills are exempt from the "every skill
  appears in the README catalog" rule, since they are intentionally not
  user-invocable.

## Why it is shaped this way

- **File-read over Skill tool** — forced by reality (no agent has an
  invocable-but-hidden state) and better anyway: sibling file reads are the
  most portable primitive across supported agents.
- **Sidecars inside the parent, not a shared hidden folder** — the parent's
  installed directory is the one location the parent can always resolve
  ("a sibling of this SKILL.md"), needs no per-agent path knowledge, and
  inherits the parent's install/uninstall/cache lifecycle for free.
- **Full wrapper, no trimmed format** (PD6) — the executed behavior had to be
  provably identical to the listed era.
- **Repo paths and identity frozen** (PD3/PD4) — runtime resume, the DB CHECK
  constraint, telemetry history, and MCP dispatch all bind to the old names
  and paths; the blast radius stayed inside the install pipeline and the
  skill prose.
- **`bill-feature-spec` stayed listed** — it is a different kind of skill
  (preparation without implementation) with a legitimate standalone life, so
  it keeps its Skill-tool contract.

## Part 2 — The code-review family (platform-pack internals, SKILL-104)

The same mechanism, extended to platform-pack skills. The code-review family
had stack-specific review skills listed to users even though the supported
entry point is `/bill-code-review`, which detects the dominant stack from
`platform.yaml` routing signals and routes automatically. Hiding them removes
dozens of listed skills from every agent's skill list and makes the listed
surface match the actual product surface.

### What changed in the contract (and what did not)

Exactly one rule changed (PD1): platform-pack skills may now declare
`internal-for`. Every other classification rule is byte-for-byte unchanged —
blank value, self parent, unknown parent, parent must be a listed base skill
under `skills/`, no chained `internal-for` (depth is 1). The pack manifest
(`platform.yaml`) is never consulted for classification; there is no
manifest-level internality flag. The review-pack frontmatter additions are the
only authored source change in the family.

### Flatten rule (PD2)

All review-pack skills — the stack entries AND their specialists —
declare `internal-for: bill-code-review`. Stack entry skills do **not** become
parents of their specialists. Nesting (specialists internal to their stack
entry, entries internal to `bill-code-review`) would require depth-2 sidecars —
a sidecar hosting sidecars — which the staging model cannot express (a sidecar
is a file, not a directory). Flattening keeps depth at 1, and sibling
co-location is what the review flow wants: the routed entry sidecar and the
specialist rubrics it reads live in one directory.

### Selection-aware sidecars (PD3) and installed layout

A base-skill internal sidecar stages whenever its parent stages. A
platform-pack internal sidecar stages only when its pack is selected
(`PlatformPackSelection`: `NONE`/`SELECTED`/`ALL`). Sidecar discovery consults
the install plan's selected pack skills (each already carries `sourceDir` and
parsed `internalFor`) rather than re-scanning `platform-packs/` independently
of selection. The parent's content hash folds exactly the selected sidecars.

After a scratch install with all packs selected, `bill-code-review`'s staged
directory contains `SKILL.md` plus 84 sibling sidecars — and no agent
`skills_dir` symlink exists for any manifest-discovered review sidecar:

```
~/.claude/skills/bill-code-review
  → ~/.skill-bill/installed-skills/bill-code-review-<content-hash>/
      SKILL.md                              rendered governed wrapper — the listed entry
      content.md                            authored source, copied verbatim
      bill-ios-code-review.md               sidecar: iOS stack entry (selected)
      bill-ios-code-review-api-contracts.md sidecar: iOS specialist
      ... (10 iOS specialists total)
      bill-go-code-review.md                sidecar: Go stack entry (selected)
      ... (10 Go specialists total)
      bill-kotlin-code-review.md            sidecar: Kotlin stack entry (selected)
      ... (10 Kotlin specialists total)
      bill-kmp-code-review.md               sidecar: KMP stack entry (selected)
      ... (7 KMP specialists; 3 effective lanes compose from Kotlin)
      bill-php-code-review.md               sidecar: PHP stack entry (selected)
      ... (10 PHP specialists total)
      bill-python-code-review.md            sidecar: Python stack entry (selected)
      ... (10 Python specialists total)
      bill-rust-code-review.md              sidecar: Rust stack entry (selected)
      ... (10 Rust specialists total)
      bill-typescript-code-review.md        sidecar: TypeScript stack entry (selected)
      ... (10 TypeScript specialists total)
      platform-packs → …                    symlink for pack pointer resolution
```

With only the Kotlin pack selected, its entry and ten review specialists stage; other packs contribute
nothing. With no review packs selected, `bill-code-review` stages
byte-identically to a repo with no internal pack skills (inertness). `ALL`
selection stages every opted-in review sidecar. SKILL-105 applies the same
selection-aware sidecar model to quality-check overrides: selected
`bill-<platform>-code-check` skills stage inside `bill-code-check/` and are not
listed commands. KMP stages and routes `bill-kmp-code-check` directly; review baseline composition never substitutes the Kotlin checker.

### Baseline co-presence guard (PD8)

The KMP pack declares `bill-kotlin-code-review` as a required baseline layer
(`platform-packs/kmp/platform.yaml`,
`code_review_composition.baseline_layers`). The KMP orchestrator reads that
baseline as a sibling sidecar at review time. Once both are sidecars, selecting
KMP without Kotlin would leave the baseline sidecar absent. Install planning
loud-fails with `MissingBaselinePlatformSelectionError` when the selection
includes a pack declaring a required baseline layer in an unselected pack;
there is no silent auto-include. `ALL` selection is trivially safe.

### Routing walkthrough

```
user: "/bill-code-review" on a Kotlin diff
  │
  ▼
bill-code-review                                   [listed]
  │  reads platform.yaml routing signals from the diff
  │  (strong signals, then tie-breakers) → dominant pack
  ▼
read sibling bill-kotlin-code-review.md            [internal sidecar]
  │  the routed pack entry sidecar; reads its specialist rubric
  │  selection table (signal → area) and spawns specialists
  │
  ├── read sibling bill-kotlin-code-review-architecture.md   [internal sidecar]
  ├── read sibling bill-kotlin-code-review-security.md       [internal sidecar]
  ├── read sibling bill-kotlin-code-review-testing.md        [internal sidecar]
  └── ... per the signal table
  │
  ▼
  each specialist's rubric executes; findings merge into the
  review summary, risk register, and verdict
```

For a KMP diff, the routed entry is `bill-kmp-code-review.md`, which also reads
`bill-kotlin-code-review.md` as its baseline layer sidecar before its own
specialists. Delegated specialist subagents and parallel lanes
receive rendered runtime instructions and rubric content/paths from the parent
orchestrator — no worker ever resolves one of the platform-pack sidecars via the Skill tool or a
standalone `skills_dir` path (PD5).

### Selection-shaped variance at a glance

| Selection | Sidecars staged inside `bill-code-review/` |
|---|---|
| `ALL` | 85 (8 stack entries + 77 specialists) |
| Kotlin only | 11 (`bill-kotlin-code-review.md` + 10 specialists) |
| KMP only | fails — Kotlin is a required baseline (PD8) |
| KMP + Kotlin | 19 (`bill-kmp-code-review` + 7 KMP specialists, `bill-kotlin-code-review` + 10 Kotlin specialists) |
| None | 0; `bill-code-review` stages inert (byte-identical to no pack internals) |

### File map additions (platform-pack side)
