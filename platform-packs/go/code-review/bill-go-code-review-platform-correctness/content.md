# Go Platform Correctness Review Specialist

Own language-level behavior and synchronization invariants. Leave component placement to architecture and service shutdown policy to reliability.

## Focus

- Goroutine exits, channel protocols, contexts, errors, aliasing, synchronization, defer, panic, races, and deadlocks
- Reachable language-level invalid states and ordering failures

## Ignore

- Package placement and component ownership decisions owned by architecture
- Operational drain, retry, and shutdown policy owned by reliability

## Applicability

Apply these checks wherever changed Go code depends on goroutine exit, channel protocol, cancellation, error identity, interface representation, copying, aliasing, or deferred execution.

## Project-Specific Rules

### Go Correctness Rules

- Require every goroutine launched by a `go` statement—including function literals, named calls such as `go worker(ctx)`, methods such as `go component.Run()`, and function values—to have a reachable exit on cancellation or completion; a missing exit leaks work and can race with teardown.
- Verify `close(ch)` appears only when closure is part of the channel protocol and is performed by its declared owner; channels need not always close, while receiver closure or uncoordinated producer closure risks `send on closed channel` or `close of closed channel` crashes.
- Require multiple producers that share a closable `chan T` to coordinate completion through `sync.WaitGroup`, `errgroup.Group`, or one closing owner before closure; racing producers against close causes panics or lost work.
- Ensure sends on `chan T` cannot outlive the receiver or block forever; an unbounded wait causes deadlock and request starvation.
- Reject `select` loops whose `default` branch spins without blocking or backoff; scheduler pressure creates latency and CPU performance regressions.
- Require derived work to propagate `ctx` and observe `ctx.Done()`; replacing it with `context.Background()` loses cancellation and causes timeout leaks.
- Verify cancellation functions returned by `context.WithCancel` or `context.WithTimeout` are called on every path; retained timers and children leak resources.
- Require wrapped errors to use `%w` when callers depend on `errors.Is` or `errors.As`; `%v` breaks the error contract and can misclassify retries or status codes.
- Reject direct equality against wrapped sentinel errors when `errors.Is` is required; the comparison produces incorrect failure handling after wrapping.
- Verify an interface containing a typed nil pointer is not treated as nil; `var x error = (*MyError)(nil)` risks unexpected branches or panics.
- Ensure copying a struct containing `sync.Mutex`, `sync.Once`, `atomic.Int64`, or `strings.Builder` is prohibited after first use; copied state risks races and corruption.
- Require slice and map ownership to account for shared backing storage; returning or appending aliased `[]byte` values can corrupt data across goroutines.
- Verify range-loop addresses and closures bind the intended iteration value under the repository's `go` directive; incorrect capture breaks state or concurrent subtests.
- Ensure `defer` arguments and receiver values are evaluated with the intended timing; stale captured data risks incorrect cleanup or error reporting.
- Reject broad `recover()` that converts programmer panics into success; hidden invariant failures leave invalid state and mask crashes.
- Require shared memory touched by multiple goroutines to use one mechanism appropriate to its contract—confinement, channel ownership, `sync.Mutex`, or `sync/atomic`; unsynchronized or mixed access risks a `go test -race` failure without imposing channels on unrelated state.
- Verify lock acquisition order is stable across code paths and callbacks do not run under `sync.Mutex` unexpectedly; inverted order risks production deadlock.
- For Blocker or Major findings, describe the concrete invalid-state or ordering failure scenario.
