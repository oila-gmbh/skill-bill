# Reliability Review Specialist

## Focus

- Promise completion, causal errors, cancellation, timeouts, and stale work
- Queues, retries, idempotency, streams, resources, and partial progress
- Node process shutdown, browser lifecycle, telemetry, and recovery decisions

## Ignore

- Retries for permanent failures or unsafe non-idempotent operations
- Telemetry requests that cannot change an operator decision
- Scale scenarios outside repository-owned workloads

## Applicability

Apply the cancellation, queue, framework, process, and telemetry contracts actually configured for the affected Node, Deno, Bun, browser, worker, or edge runtime.

## Project-Specific Rules

### Promise and Cancellation Failure Rules

- Callers must observe every promise through `await`, return, or an explicit supervisor; flag unawaited or floating promises and async callbacks whose rejection becomes data loss or process instability. Verify the lint diagnostic and captured `unhandledRejection` outcome before reporting this failure.
- `catch` blocks and framework handlers must preserve `cause` and stable error classification; reject swallowed failures that prevent retry, response mapping, or incident diagnosis. Verify the serialized `Error.cause` chain and mapped response or retry classification before reporting this failure.
- `AbortSignal` or the repository cancellation token must propagate through fetches, streams, timers, and child tasks; prevent stale work from committing after a timeout or newer request. Verify abort listeners, downstream signal identity, and the post-cancellation side-effect log before reporting this failure.
- Timeout races must clear losing timers and observe losing promises; flag a lifecycle leak or unhandled rejection after the caller has returned. Verify `vi.getTimerCount()` or equivalent timer handles and rejection capture after the winning branch completes before reporting this failure.

### Queue, Retry, and Stream Contract Rules

- Queue producers must have bounded admission and consumers must enforce concurrency; reject memory growth, starvation, or overload when downstream capacity is exhausted. Verify `queue.depth`, admission-rejection, and active-consumer observations under a saturated fixture before reporting this failure.
- Retries must classify transient failures, cap attempts with backoff, and preserve an `idempotency-key` or equivalent operation identity; prevent duplicate writes or messages. Verify attempt timestamps, operation keys, and durable write counts from a retry scenario before reporting this failure.
- Stream pipelines must propagate errors, cancellation, backpressure, and close signals across Node and Web stream adapters; flag truncation, resource leaks, or stuck consumers. Verify chunk counts, `desiredSize` or drain observations, and both endpoint close states before reporting this failure.
- Partial multi-step operations must record progress or compensate according to the durable contract; reject a retry path that repeats completed side effects. Verify the persisted `operation_steps` ledger and downstream side-effect counts across interruption and replay before reporting this failure.

### Shutdown and Observability Failure Rules

- Node, Bun, or Deno shutdown must stop intake, drain or abandon jobs by policy, close servers and pools, and respect `SIGTERM`; prevent deployment hangs or dropped acknowledged work. Verify `SIGTERM` delivery, intake rejection, drain completion, and open-handle output before reporting this failure.
- Browser components and workers must remove listeners, subscriptions, channels, and timers on navigation or termination; flag stale updates and retained-resource leaks. Verify `removeEventListener` calls or timer counts and worker termination events after teardown before reporting this failure.
- Logs, metrics, and traces must carry operation identity, failure class, attempt, and terminal outcome without exposing secrets; reject telemetry that hides timeout, cancellation, retry, or queue saturation. Verify emitted `trace_id` span attributes, metric labels, and redacted structured log fields before reporting this failure.
- Dependency degradation must have an explicit fallback, fail-closed, or fail-fast contract tested with repository fault injection; prevent cascading availability failure from ambiguous partial success. Verify fault-injection responses, `circuit_state`, and downstream request volume before reporting this failure.
- For Blocker or Major findings, describe the concrete availability, duplication, or cleanup failure scenario.
