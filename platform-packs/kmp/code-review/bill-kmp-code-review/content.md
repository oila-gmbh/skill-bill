# Android/KMP PR Review

Treat the generated flattened Review Composition plan as authoritative. Launch its Kotlin and KMP specialists directly; never launch the Kotlin baseline orchestrator as a nested worker.

## Classification Rules

- If `kotlin("multiplatform")`, `org.jetbrains.kotlin.multiplatform`, `commonMain`, `androidMain`, `iosMain`, or paired `expect`/`actual` declarations dominate, select the KMP pack.
- If Android markers coexist with KMP source sets, keep the KMP route because it retains the Kotlin baseline and KMP specialists.
- Otherwise, select the adjacent Kotlin pack when no multiplatform boundary is present.
- Exclude generated, vendored, and non-stack files from routing dominance.

## Diff-Signal Routing Table

- `expect`/`actual`, `commonMain`, `androidMain`, `iosMain`, source-set dependencies, or target-boundary declarations -> `platform-correctness` specialist.
- `kotlinx.serialization`, polymorphic registration, `kotlinx-datetime`, timezone behavior, `Dispatchers.Main`, iOS dispatchers, ObjC exports, Skie `Flow`, or suspend cancellation -> `platform-correctness` specialist.
- `@Composable`, UI state, `Modifier`, `remember`, `LaunchedEffect`, navigation, previews, or loading/content/error/empty states -> `ui` specialist.
- Compose semantics, labels, focus, TalkBack, keyboard behavior, localization, or touch targets -> `ux-accessibility` specialist.
- `proguard-rules.pro`, `consumer-rules.pro`, `isMinifyEnabled`, `minifyEnabled`, or R8 configuration -> `platform-correctness` specialist; include the baseline `android-r8` add-on.
- Navigation graphs, `NavController`, `SavedStateHandle`, `popUpTo`, `launchSingleTop`, or dialog destinations -> `ui` specialist; include the UI `android-navigation` add-on.

## Mixed Diffs

- Keep KMP routing for the whole review when strong multiplatform signals coexist with backend, Android, or generic Kotlin files.
- Use lightweight file-level classification to scope each specialist to matching files without dropping a selected lane.
- Exclude generated, vendored, and non-stack files from specialist scope unless a generated contract is itself the reviewed artifact.
- Preserve the manifest-declared Kotlin baseline as direct lanes for the same whole-review scope, then merge and deduplicate findings without losing the `kmp -> kotlin` attribution chain.

## Finding Discipline

- Report only reachable failures with a concrete precondition and observed consequence.
- Assign severity from impact, keep every finding attributed to its baseline, specialist, or add-on lane, and deduplicate without erasing ownership.
- Read selected specialist sidecars from the installed `bill-code-review` directory; do not invoke internal specialists through a skill command.
