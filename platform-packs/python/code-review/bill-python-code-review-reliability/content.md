# Python Reliability Review

Review behavior under dependency failure, load, worker restarts, and deploy operations.

## Focus

- External clients, timeouts, retries, queues, workers, schedulers, caches, observability, replay, shutdown, and graceful degradation

## Ignore

- Hypothetical operational concerns without a reachable failure path or ownership boundary
- Telemetry naming preferences that cannot hide, misclassify, or expose a production failure

## Applicability

Use this specialist for `requests`, `httpx`, external clients, Celery, RQ, Arq, Dramatiq, schedulers, cron jobs, queues, caches, long-running commands, and operational lifecycle code.

## Project-Specific Rules

### Python Reliability Rules

- Require an effective bounded timeout at the owned client or call boundary for every outbound path: accept repository-owned shared client policy or explicit Requests `timeout=<seconds>` or `timeout=(connect, read)` and `httpx.Timeout` connect, read, write, and pool limits; absent effective limits leak sockets and cause cascading timeouts.
- Verify retries configured through `urllib3.Retry`, `tenacity`, or repository policy classify transient failures, honor `Retry-After`, add jitter, and stop after a bound; indiscriminate replay risks storms and invalid duplicate writes.
- Require an idempotency key, durable deduplication record, or safe operation contract before retrying mutations; process restarts or client retries can otherwise corrupt state through duplication.
- Require bounded `asyncio.Queue` capacity and, for brokered workers, queue-depth or admission limits with an explicit overflow, rejection, or producer-throttling policy in addition to prefetch and worker concurrency; consumer in-flight bounds alone allow backlog growth to exhaust broker storage during dependency slowdown.
- Verify poison messages have an attempt limit and a dead-letter or quarantine path in Celery, RQ, Arq, or Dramatiq configuration; permanent failures must not loop forever and starve valid work.
- Require a transactionally written atomic outbox when work derived from database state must survive process failure; permit Django `transaction.on_commit` publication only when loss after commit is explicitly acceptable or a durable reconciliation path detects and republishes it, because enqueue-before-commit exposes missing data while a crash before an after-commit callback loses required delivery.
- When Celery is detected, verify `acks_late`, task idempotency, and the active broker's acknowledgement and redelivery controls agree with maximum runtime, using `visibility_timeout` only for transports that support it and applicable AMQP acknowledgement or dead-letter settings otherwise; mismatches risk task loss or concurrent redelivery.
- Require owned cancellation and awaited cleanup during partial failure on every supported Python version. Accept `asyncio.TaskGroup`, an AnyIO task group, or explicitly retained tasks whose cancellation, observation, and join are owned and awaited; unowned tasks can mutate state after the request reports failure.
- Verify `Executor.shutdown(wait=True, cancel_futures=True)` or equivalent service teardown stops admissions before resources close; leaked executor work delays deploy shutdown and accesses invalid clients.
- Require graceful worker shutdown to stop new admissions before handling already accepted work; accepted jobs must drain, be durably requeued or negatively acknowledged, or enter an observable terminal state before `httpx.AsyncClient`, sessions, and file descriptors close, because discarding queued work or reversing lifecycle order causes job loss and resource leaks.
- Require long-running commands, consumers, and workers to define durable checkpoint writes, interruption cleanup, restart position, and duplicate-safe replay after cancellation or process death; advancing progress before durable effects can skip work, while replay without idempotency can duplicate it.
- Require structured `logging`, metrics, trace correlation, and terminal error status for retry exhaustion and degraded fallbacks; silent failure paths prevent operators from detecting data loss or availability regressions.
- Verify circuit-breaker recovery probes and fallback data are bounded and visibly stale through the repository telemetry contract; permanent open state or hidden stale responses break service contracts.
- Require scheduler jobs to hold a distributed lease or use an idempotent `Celery beat` task contract; overlapping executions race and can corrupt durable state.
- Verify worker health and readiness expose broker, database, and dependency failure through configured `logging` and metrics; false-ready processes cause routing and availability failures.
- Reject broad `except Exception` acknowledgement in RQ, Celery, or Dramatiq handlers; swallowed errors lose failure identity and can mark invalid work successful.
- For Blocker or Major findings, describe the concrete availability, duplication, or cleanup failure scenario.
