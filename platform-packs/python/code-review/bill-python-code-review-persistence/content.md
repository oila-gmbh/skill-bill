# Python Persistence Review

Review data correctness and persistence lifecycle.

## Focus

- ORM and raw SQL behavior, migrations, transactions, locking, sessions, bulk writes, tenant scope, and cross-store consistency

## Ignore

- Query style preferences without a correctness, consistency, durability, or material performance consequence
- Schema or ORM code outside the changed transaction and data ownership boundary

## Applicability

Use this specialist for SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, peewee, raw SQL, query builders, migrations, repositories, connection pools, sessions, outboxes, and cache invalidation.

## Project-Specific Rules

### Python Persistence Rules

- Require explicit, non-overlapping responsibility ownership for SQLAlchemy `Session` or `AsyncSession` creation, transaction completion, rollback, and close. Different components may own different responsibilities only when each responsibility has one unambiguous owner; overlap or gaps risk partial commits and connection leaks after exceptions.
- Verify `expire_on_commit` and lazy relationship access before returning ORM objects beyond session scope; detached loads can fail after a response has begun.
- Account for SQLAlchemy `autoflush` before `select` or relationship queries and require `no_autoflush` only around an intentional invariant; premature writes can trigger invalid constraints.
- Reject concurrent use of one `AsyncSession` across `asyncio.gather` tasks; session state is mutable and races can corrupt transaction ordering.
- Require explicit isolation and locking through `with_for_update`, version columns, or database constraints for contested updates; unchecked read-modify-write loses data under concurrency.
- Require the whole transaction to roll back before a bounded retry of classified serialization failures or deadlocks; independently require a uniqueness constraint, durable deduplication record, idempotency key, or demonstrably idempotent operation only for external effects or an ambiguous commit outcome, because a fully rolled-back database mutation can be replayed safely while an uncertain effect can be duplicated.
- When Django is detected, verify nested `transaction.atomic` savepoints and `transaction.on_commit` callbacks preserve durable ordering; external effects before outer commit risk phantom delivery.
- Verify `bulk_create`, `bulk_update`, and `QuerySet.update` account for bypassed `save`, signals, validation, and `auto_now`; reliance on skipped hooks leaves contract data invalid.
- Require a trusted tenant predicate on every tenant-owned SQLAlchemy, Django ORM, or raw SQL read and write, including upserts, unless verified database-per-tenant, schema-per-tenant, or session-enforced isolation is established before queries and cannot be bypassed by raw SQL, background work, or reused sessions; unverified scoping creates cross-tenant exposure or data loss.
- Require Alembic or Django migrations to use expand-and-contract ordering and deploy-compatible defaults; incompatible schema transitions break mixed-version application instances.
- Require `RunPython` or Alembic data migrations and backfills to be resumable, idempotent, bounded, and reversible where possible; interruption otherwise leaves corrupt partial state.
- Verify production index creation uses the database's non-blocking mechanism when table size makes locks unsafe; for PostgreSQL `CONCURRENTLY`, require Django `AddIndexConcurrently` in a migration with `atomic = False` or an Alembic `autocommit_block`, plus detection and recovery of an invalid index after interruption, because running concurrent DDL inside a transaction or leaving a failed index behind breaks deployment availability.
- Require an atomic outbox or equivalent transaction-owned record for event publication and cache-consistency work; cache updates must use durable delivery and reconciliation, or a bounded-staleness design with versioned keys, explicit TTL, and repair, because an after-commit invalidation can fail after durable data changes and leave stale reads indefinitely.
- Require cardinality-appropriate eager loading: Django `select_related` or SQLAlchemy `joinedload` for scalar relationships, and `prefetch_related` or `selectinload` for collections where appropriate. Demand bounded query-count evidence proving query growth does not scale with result cardinality; uncontrolled N+1 access causes latency and resource failure.
- Treat projections such as Django `values` or `values_list`, SQLAlchemy `load_only`, and selected columns as remedies for unused fields and hydration cost, not substitutes for relationship loading; conflating the two leaves either query multiplication or over-fetch unresolved.
- Require unique constraints and explicit `IntegrityError` conflict mapping for idempotent writes; check-then-insert races can corrupt contract data with duplicates.
- For Blocker or Major findings, describe the concrete data-loss, consistency, or durability failure scenario.
