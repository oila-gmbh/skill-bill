## Focus

- Auth/authz logic gaps and session/token misuse
- Sensitive logging (PII/token leakage)
- Insecure storage/transport assumptions
- Security regressions from new code paths

## Ignore
- Non-security style comments

## Output Rules

- Include abuse scenario for each Major/Blocker.
- Include `file:line` evidence for each finding.
- Severity: `Blocker | Major | Minor`
- Confidence: `High | Medium | Low`
- Include a minimal, concrete fix.

## Output Table
