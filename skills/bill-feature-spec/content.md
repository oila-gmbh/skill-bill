# Feature Spec Preparation

`bill-feature-spec` prepares governed feature-spec artifacts without starting implementation. Every successful preparation emits a parent spec, one or more distinct executable subtask specs, and a schema-valid manifest for `bill-feature-goal` execution.

## Intake Contract

Collect and confirm:

- issue key
- intended outcome
- acceptance criteria
- known constraints and non-goals

If the issue key is missing, stop and ask for it. Do not invent one.

## Mode Selection

Classify into one of two modes:

- `single_spec`: one normal implementation pass is appropriate
- `decomposed`: multiple independently resumable subtasks are required

Use `single_spec` by default unless the work clearly needs multiple dependency-ordered subtasks. Mode is sizing and planning metadata only; it never changes the artifact shape or executor.

## Service / Spec Source Mode

`bill-feature-spec` accepts an optional `service:default/linear` argument that selects where
the prepared spec is tracked. This is orthogonal to `single_spec` vs `decomposed`: either mode
may run under either service.

Resolve the effective spec-source mode with the runtime, which encapsulates the precedence
`service: arg > config spec_type > local` and loud-fails on a malformed `.skill-bill/config.yaml`:

```bash
skill-bill config resolve-spec-type --arg <service-arg-or-empty>
```

- Pass the value after `service:` as `--arg` (for example `--arg linear` or `--arg local`).
  When no `service:` argument is given, or it is `service:default`, pass an empty `--arg` (or
  `--arg default`) so the command falls back to the repo-local `spec_type` and then to `local`.
- A `0` exit prints the resolved mode (`local` or `linear`) on stdout; use that as the
  effective mode.
- A non-zero exit means the config is malformed or the service value is unrecognized. Surface
  that failure and stop — do not guess a mode.

If the resolved mode is `linear`, follow **Linear Mode Preparation** before writing artifacts.
Otherwise follow **Local Mode**.

## Linear Mode Preparation

Run only when the resolved spec-source mode is `linear`. Execute these steps in this exact
order so that no Linear issue is created and no artifact is written unless the whole sequence
can proceed (no partial state):

1. **Verify the Linear MCP is available and authenticated.** If it is unavailable or
   unauthenticated, loud-fail with a clear message **before** creating any Linear issue or
   writing any artifact. Create nothing and write nothing on this path.
2. **Compose all spec content in memory first** — the parent spec, every subtask spec, and
   the manifest. The `.feature-specs/{KEY}-{name}/` directory name is not known
   until the parent issue key is returned, so do not write to disk yet.
3. **Create the parent Linear issue**, tagged `task`, whose description is the parent spec
   content. Capture the returned issue key.
4. **Create one sub-issue per subtask**, each tagged `task`, each description
   carrying that subtask's spec content under a clear per-subtask header so the ticket is
   human-legible. Capture each sub-issue's `linear_issue_id`. Rehydration keys off
   `linear_issue_id`, not header text, so the header is for humans only.
5. **Adopt the parent issue's returned key** as the issue key, the
   `.feature-specs/{KEY}-{name}/` directory name, and the manifest `issue_key`.
6. **Write via the shared preparation path**, stamping manifest `spec_source: linear` and
   recording every subtask's `linear_issue_id`. Do not fork writing logic by preparation mode.
7. **Mid-sequence failure (orphan parent):** if a sub-issue create fails after the parent
   issue already exists, loud-fail surfacing the created parent key and any created sub-issue
   keys for manual cleanup, and write no artifacts.

## Local Mode

Run when the resolved spec-source mode is `local` (no config, `spec_type: local`, or
`service:local`). Local mode is unchanged from today:

- Make no Linear calls.
- `spec_source` resolves to `local`.
- Omit the optional manifest `spec_source` field; absence is read as `local`.

## Shared Preparation Path

Always route preparation through the shared feature-spec preparation path. Do not fork logic between `bill-feature-spec`, `bill-feature-task`, and `bill-feature-goal`.

The agent writes all governed artifacts through one validate-and-render path: parent `spec.md`, one or more ordered `spec_subtask_*.md` files, and `decomposition-manifest.yaml` using the template below. Construct and schema-validate the complete bundle before the first write, then atomically replace each file. A bare existing `spec.md` is intake: preserve its intended outcome, acceptance criteria, constraints, and non-goals while upgrading it to this artifact set.

## Spec Format Contract

Every parent and subtask spec is read back by the runtime
(`FileSystemFeatureTaskRuntimeRunInvariantsSource`) to extract its acceptance
criteria. That reader is format-sensitive, so authored specs MUST follow this
contract or the runtime fails the run with "must list at least one criterion":

- The acceptance-criteria section heading MUST begin with `## Acceptance Criteria`
  (case-insensitive). A trailing qualifier such as `## Acceptance Criteria (this subtask)`
  is allowed; a different heading word is not.
- Each criterion MUST be its own list item: a numbered item (`1. ...`) or a
  bullet (`- ...`, optionally a `- [ ]` checkbox). Do not place criteria in
  prose paragraphs under the heading.
- At least one criterion is required in every spec the runtime will execute.

Prefer the canonical numbered form the runtime writer emits:

```markdown
## Acceptance Criteria

1. First criterion.
2. Second criterion.
```

## Output Rules

- write or update parent `spec.md`
- write one or more ordered `spec_subtask_*.md` files; a one-unit feature has exactly one distinct subtask
- write or update `.feature-specs/{ISSUE_KEY}-{feature-name}/decomposition-manifest.yaml`

Write the manifest file directly from the template below. Fill every placeholder with values from the planning subagent's decomposition RESULT; do not leave any placeholder literal in the written file.

```yaml
contract_version: "0.4"
issue_key: "ISSUE-KEY"          # string, required
feature_name: "feature-name"    # string, required
parent_spec_path: ".feature-specs/ISSUE-KEY-feature-name/spec.md"  # string, required
spec_source: local               # local | linear; omit for local (runtime default)
execution_model: same_branch_commit_per_subtask  # same_branch_commit_per_subtask | stacked_branches
base_branch: main                # string, required
feature_branch: feat/ISSUE-KEY-feature-name  # string|null; non-null for same_branch_commit_per_subtask
stack_branches: []               # array; empty for same_branch_commit_per_subtask
current_subtask_intent:
  subtask_id: 1                  # integer >= 0; 0 when no subtask is active (none or complete)
  action: start                  # none (initial, nothing started) | start | resume | blocked | complete (all done)
subtasks:
  - id: 1                        # integer >= 1
    name: "Subtask name"         # string, required
    spec_path: ".feature-specs/ISSUE-KEY-feature-name/spec_subtask_1_slug.md"  # string, required
    status: pending              # pending | in_progress | blocked | complete | skipped
    branch: null                 # string|null; null until the runtime assigns one
    commit_sha: null             # string|null; null until the subtask commits
    workflow_id: null            # string|null; null until the runtime opens a workflow
    blocked_reason: null         # string|null; null unless status is blocked
    last_resumable_step: null    # string|null; null unless the subtask was interrupted
    linear_issue_id: null        # string|null; null for local spec_source
    dependencies: []             # array of {subtask_id, optional, skipped}
```

The manifest is validated against the decomposition manifest schema contract before persistence and again when the runtime reads it.

Each subtask spec must contain scope, acceptance criteria, non-goals, dependency notes, validation strategy, and next path. The acceptance-criteria section must follow the **Spec Format Contract** above so the runtime can extract it.

Return the next command as:

```bash
skill-bill goal <issue_key>
```

## Goal Runner Boundary

`skill-bill goal <issue_key>` is consumer-only. It must not synthesize specs from prose. If no decomposition manifest exists, it should continue to loud-fail and direct callers back to preparation.
